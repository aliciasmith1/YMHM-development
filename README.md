*Youth Mental Health Map (YMHM) – Analysis Repository

This repository contains the analysis scripts and data processing code for a two-part study that developed and validated the Youth Mental Health Map (YMHM) – a digital, youth-centric self-report questionnaire designed to assess transdiagnostic mental health symptoms in young people.

--

In this two-part study, we developed and validated a digital, youth-centric self-report mental health questionnaire that measures scores on four core transdiagnostic symptom clusters identified using a novel data-driven, machine learning-based approach:

1. **Uncontrollable Thinking Patterns**  
2. **Re-experiencing Difficult Events**  
3. **Rigid High Standards**  
4. **Emotional Agency**
  

**Study 1 (EFA & Item Reduction):**

Factor analytic approach extracted four latent symptom dimensions
Multi-target lasso regression reduced 196 questionnaire items to 34


**Study 2 (Validation & Reliability):**

Test-retest reliability
Internal consistency
Construct validity
Predictive validity
